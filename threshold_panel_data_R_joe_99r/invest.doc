INVEST.DOC

The data file INVEST.DAT has observations on 565 firms over the 15 years
1973-1987.

The data are taken from the data file "pstar.dat" originally created
by B.H. Hall and R.E. Hall for "The Value and Performance of U.S.
Corporations" (Brookings Papers, 1993).  This file, and documentation
file "pstar.doc" may be downloaded from the NBER FTP page.

INVEST.DAT contains observations on four variables.  Using the notation
from B. Hall's documentation file "pstar.doc":

*  inva     investment to assets ratio.
*  vala     total market value to assets ratio ("Tobin's Q").
*  cfa      cash flow to assets ratio.
*  debta    long term debt to assets ratio.


The file "invest.dat" is a 8475x4 matrix.  The four variables are
in each of the four columes, in the above order.  The observations
are listed firm by firm (first 15 observations are from the first firm, 
second 15 observations from the second, etc.).

The orginal Hall data is an unbalanced panel for a longer set of years.
Invest.dat contains all firms which had no missing values on the
four selected variables for the years 1973-1987.
